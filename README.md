# image_class
Creating a image classification web app using streamlit and machine learning

Creating Model is just the model I used to create the model that is used in Streamlit_app

To run the project, insure you download all dependecies.

After installing tensorflow, numpy, matplotlib, and streamlit.

Run the Creating_Model.py file to create the model

Then in the same folder, run the command "streamlit run streamlit_app.py" This will open in localhost where you can see the project.

** Could not publish because the model file is too big to upload on github. **
